I fixed errors with some weapon addons which saves their weapon information not correctly.                                    
**weapon addons with erros fixed:**
- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=832748942 (CW2.0 Weapon Pack for TTT)				                          

  if there are still errors from other weapon addons, contact me with the full message from your gmod console.

Also added a information about the current weapon when the scoreboard shows up.
